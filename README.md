# Snap!
The project is a simple card game running in the command line. 
The game starts by dividing a deck of cards equally between two players. Then, the players displays one card at the time, 
and when the value of the card turned matches the previous one, the quickest player to say 'Snap!' wins. 
A random 'thinking' time is added after displaying a card.


##How to run it
To start the game run 'main.py' file. 

Names of the players and their thinking time can be changed in the 'constant.py' file.
